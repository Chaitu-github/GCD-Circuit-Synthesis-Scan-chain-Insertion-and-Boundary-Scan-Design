# GCD-Circuit-Synthesis-Scan-chain-Insertion-and-Boundary-Scan-Design
•Synthesized GCD Circuit using Synopsys Design Compiler and Scan chain insertion using   DFT 
  compiler. Generated test patterns(ATPG) for the synthesized GCD design using TetraMax.
•Performed Boundary scan design using Synopsys BSD Compiler and integrated it with the internal 
  scan chain.
